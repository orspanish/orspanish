# Olivia Spanish (Email: ospanis@calstatela.edu)
Hello! My name is Olivia Spanish (she/her) and I am a recent applied mathematics and bioinformatics graduate. I am currently conducting research in the Momand Lab at Cal State University,
Los Angeles under the mentorship of Dr. Jamil Momand. Our project is focused on using machine learning methods to predict human protein half-lives based on the intrinsic properties of 
human proteins. These intrinsic properties can be things such as subcellular location, 3D-structure, N and C terminus sequence data, ubiquitination status, methylation status, and other 
biological characteristics. This repository is a platform in which I hope to showcase my work in both the Momand Lab and other external projects.
